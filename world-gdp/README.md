# World's-GDP
A project based on a World GDP by Country, Region, and Income Group dataset, which provides a comprehensive view of global economics, centered on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This dataset comprises various key indicators related to GDP, covering from 1960 up to 2022. In the primary dataset (gdp_data.csv), you'll find country-specific GDP values, years, and unique country codes. The supplementary dataset (country_codes.csv) complements it by providing country regions and income group classifications, facilitating a multifaceted analysis of the global economic landscape.

In the project, I write several queries to analyse the data and show some insight concerning countries's GDP.
