# Global-Emissions-By-Countries
A project based on a Tracking Global CO2 Emissions (1990-2023) dataset, which provides a detailed account of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions spanning from 1990 to 2023 for countries across the world. The amount of carbon dioxide emissions in metric tons for each country and year, providing granular and organized data for analysis.
In the project, I write several queries to analyse the data and show some meaningful insight concerning different countries of the world.
